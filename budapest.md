# Recommendations for Budapest


Some food-related recommendations:

* [Trófea restaurant](https://www.trofea.hu/en/) (I am told it is good, but it is way too much food for me so I never tried it)
* [Hadik kávéház](http://www.hadik.hu/hadik) restaurant. Bartók Béla út 36, near Hotel Gellért.
* [Csalánosi Csárda](https://csalanosi-obuda.hu/) Oversized portion. I loved the Hortobágyi, but I think a first course of Hortobágyi is mostly enough for a person. Hídfő utca 16. Óbuda.
* [Babka](https://www.babkabudapest.hu/) - I have not tried it yet.
* [Kőleves Vendéglő](https://www.koleves.com/) (Stonesoup Restaurant and Garden) is in the are of the Ghetto.

* [Rablóhús](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=rabl%C3%B3h%C3%BAs&t=ffab&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)
* [Halászlé](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hal%C3%A1szl%C3%A9&t=ffab&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)
* [Hortobágyi húsos palacsinta](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hortobagyi+palacsinta&t=ffab&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)


## Street-food

* [Lángos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ngos) tipical street-foodor maybe beach-food. You can probably buy some in the markets.

## Local sweets - pastry shops

If you want to eat cakes or other sweets:

* [Daubner](http://daubnercukraszda.hu/) There are a few tables. Most people buy take away.  Probably the best icecream and best cakes in the country. It is not in the center of the city, but it is worth it. 
* [Auguszt](https://auguszt.hu/en/) I know the one in [Fény utca](https://auguszt1870.hu/) this is the "original". There is a small garden to sit down.
* [Szamos](https://www.szamos.hu/) have many shops around the city. Started out as a marzipan shop, and now it has lots of places with excellent icecreams, cakes, and marzipans.
* [Sommer Cukrászda](https://sommer-cukraszda.hu/) I have not tried this yet.
* Raj Ráchel Cake Salon - Budapest, Veres Pálné u. 31, 1053 Hungary - I think this was closed, but they had the best Flódni.

* [Házi rétesbolt](https://www.facebook.com/people/H%C3%A1zi-r%C3%A9tesbolt/100043286967242/) - they sell excellent Strudel  Pozsonyi út 15. Near the Margit bride. Take away. If the weather permits you can sit in a near-by park, on the Danube river bench or you can take your rétes and go to the Margarate Island. For me the rétes never lasted that long. Apparently they have another shop on Karinthy Frigyes út 4-6. That's near the Alle shopping mall and Hotel Gellért with the pool.

* [Réttesbolt](https://retesbolt.hu/) (rétes = strudel) I have not tried this yet. Lehel utca 38 25 min from Hero's Square. Or Vas utca 1, 8 min walk from the Dohány Synagogue.

## Pubs

* [Rom Kocsmák](https://www.romkocsmak.hu/) or [Ruin Pubs](https://www.ruinpubs.com/) in English are fun places.
* The whole area in what was the [Jewish Ghetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Ghetto) has a lot of pubs, coffee shops and restaurants.
* [Gozsdu Udvar](https://www.gozsduudvar.hu/) is [located](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gozsdu+udvar/@47.4973247,19.05718,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4741da37933d1b69:0x33ba687fd1fe38f9") in that area too.
