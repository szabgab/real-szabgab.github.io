# from Mesilat Zion to Beit Meir and back

Saturday, December 2, 2017 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM IST


• What we'll do
We meet at 9:00 at the entrance of Mesilat Zion. We'll walk through Park Rabin to Beit Meir. From there we go on the ridge above road 1 and descend to Makhal Memorial. From there we walk back to Mesilat Zion. (The last part is is on the road and can be avoided if we have at least two cars and park one of them near the gas station.)

The approximate route can be seen here: https://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=16721256
It can take about 3-3:30 hours.

I am arriving from Modiin and can take others. If you are coming by car and can take others please post to the group. If you are interested to come, but you depend on a ride, please post that too.

If you are planning to come RSVP here and send me a message (WhatsApp is fine) to 054-4624648 with your name.
