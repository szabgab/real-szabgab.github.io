Friday prefer after 13:00 so I can bring my kid. Weekdays for a good trip with advance notice its possible to take a day off.
If I'm on vacation then also weekdays.
Friday afternoon is also good, if a ride back to Jerusalem is available.
I have to be in TLV by 5pm on Fridays

I do not have a car and always appreciate a ride, but can take public transportation if the hiking area is easily accessible that way (except of course on Shabbat, when public transit is not available.
I may have a rented car or may needa lift

### Free comments

I would like to do part of the Israel trail if anyone is interested.

I have a phobia of dogs. Is there an option to have hikes that are for humans only?
I would love to bring my dog :)
