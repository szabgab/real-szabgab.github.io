This was in the Meetup group for more than 2 years, but as I don't plan to do it myself I have cancelled it:

Hello folks!
An offer came from the people here to do the "sea to sea" trail.
I probably won't be able to join, but as a person who did it 3 times I'll share some of my thoughts on the subject.
First, here is the official trail page info:
http://www.tiuli.com/track_info.asp?track_id=157

Now some info from me:

1. It is better to start from Avdon rather than from Axziv, since the first several Km are under the sun in a boring farm. In any way the buses to these two places go from Naharia's central station.

2. In order to make the track as easy as possible there is an option to rent a guesthouse in Abirim in the end of the first day. They usually offer dinner and breakfast, thus it'll lighten the burden.
In the end of day two it is possible to rest in "bet sefer sade meron", no food provided there, only accommodations.

Doing that, however, will leave you mount meron and both upper and lower naxal amud, which is quite a lot for one day, so take in into consideration.

That is all from me for now, feel free to ask me anything.
Cheers,
Mark.
