# Lower Nahal Zeelim

Saturday, December 30, 2017 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM IST

Based on this hike: https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/lower-nahal-zeelim-21014675
it is going to be about 16 km and will take about 7 hours.
We should start hiking at 8:30 so we get back by 15:30-16:00
I've created an approximate map that I'll update later on.

It won't be an easy hike!

We definitely need to organize carpool for this as there is no point driving there in separate cars.

What to bring:

    hiking boots
    hiking sticks can be useful
    4 liter of water
    light snack
    enough food for the day
    hat
    Sun protection cream

Carpool:

We know that many of our guests need help getting to the trail and back home which is especially difficult during Shabbat.
We don't organize car pooling but we'd like to see you self-organize for that.
We would like to encourage every participant who comes by car and can offer a ride to post a comment telling us where she/he is coming from. We would also like to encourage guests to post if they need a ride. Meetup allows personal messages via the site. You can get in touch with the others who posted and arrange for the ride.
