Carpool:

We know that many of our guests need help getting to the trail and back home which is especially difficult during Shabbat.
We don't organize car pooling but we'd like to see you self-organize for that.
We would like to encourage every participant who comes by car and can offer a ride to post a comment telling us where she/he is coming from. We would also like to encourage guests to post if they need a ride. Meetup allows personal messages via the site. You can get in touch with the others who posted and arrange for the ride.
